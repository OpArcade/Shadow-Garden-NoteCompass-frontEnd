Our project NoteCompass main purpose is to provide notes from teachers to students.

In this, there is a CMS portal through which  teachers can upload notes and for students, there is a client server through which users can find their notes as per their requirements.

This site also contains NoteCompass GPT(General Progressive Transformer) which is created by us. (in the developing phase)
